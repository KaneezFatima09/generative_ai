# Generative AI Projects

This repository contains my practice projects in Generative AI, including implementations of GANs, VAEs, Transformers, and other generative models.

## What is Generative AI?

Generative AI refers to deep learning models that can generate new data (such as images, text, or audio) by learning from existing data.
Examples include:

GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) → generate realistic images/text.

VAEs (Variational Autoencoders) → learn compressed latent representations and generate new samples.

Transformers → generate sequences like text, music, or code.

## Projects Included

✅ GAN (MNIST) → Created my first GAN trained on handwritten digits. /
⬜ DCGAN (CIFAR-10) → Deeper convolutional GAN for colored images. /
⬜ VAE (Images) → Learn compressed latent representations./
⬜ Text Generation (Transformer/RNN) → Generate text sequences. /

(I will keep adding more projects as I learn.)
