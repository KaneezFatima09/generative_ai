Generative AI Projects

This repository contains my practice projects in Generative AI, including implementations of GANs, VAEs, Transformers, and other generative models.

What is Generative AI?

Generative AI refers to deep learning models that can generate new data (such as images, text, or audio) by learning from existing data.
Examples include:

GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) â†’ generate realistic images/text.

VAEs (Variational Autoencoders) â†’ learn compressed latent representations and generate new samples.

Transformers â†’ generate sequences like text, music, or code.

ðŸš€ Projects Included

âœ… GAN (MNIST) â†’ Created my first GAN trained on handwritten digits.
â¬œ DCGAN (CIFAR-10) â†’ Deeper convolutional GAN for colored images.
â¬œ VAE (Images) â†’ Learn compressed latent representations.
â¬œ Text Generation (Transformer/RNN) â†’ Generate text sequences.

(I will keep adding more projects as I learn.)
